-   METIS Ver.5 series supported

-   Settings of Makefile.conf when using REVOCAP\_Refiner has been
    changed (see Appendix A: List of Makefile.conf Variables (8)
    and (10))

-   Tuned code for K-computer and Fujitsu FX10 is available (see
    Appendix C: Notes on K-computer and Fujitsu FX10)
