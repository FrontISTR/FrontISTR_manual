# Finite Element Method Analysis Theory

Chapter 2 describes the analysis method by the finite element method
(FEM) used in this development code. Regarding the stress analysis
method of solids, the infinitesimal deformation linear elasticity static
analysis method is described first, and the geometric nonlinear analysis
method and the elastoplasticity analysis method which are required when
handling finite deformation problems are described next. Furthermore, a
summarized evaluation method of the fracture mechanics parameters which
can be acquired using the results of the stress analysis by FEM is
described. Finally, the eigenvalue analysis and heat conduction analysis
method is described.
