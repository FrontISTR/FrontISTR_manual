## Example of Actual Model for Heat Conduction Analysis

### Analysis Model

In heat conduction analysis, a spent nuclear fuel shipping container was
used as the actual model. A verification example of three types of
actual models where the roughness of the mesh was changed was used for
verification. A list is shown in Table 9.4.1. The shape of the models is
shown in Figure 9.4.1 \~ Figure 9.4.4.
